# Churn-Analysis-App
<br/>
I explored the phenomenon of Churn in relation to a telecommunications company, and built an R Shiny app to illustrate the results. I did not spend much time optimising the various algorithms that were used in the project - my primary purpose was to showcase the type of app that I can make from scratch. The app employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence, and provides insight into some of the contemporary techniques that are used to help illuminate the results of machine learning models.   I initially developed the app with a quirky design theme in mind, however I eventually decided to redesign it with a more streamlined interface - the new version can be viewed at this address : https://isaacgamal.shinyapps.io/ChurnRate/  .
