# Churn-Analysis-App
<br/>
I decided to a built an app that features cutting-edge artificial intelligence. I explored the phenomenon of Churn, and built an R Shiny app to illustrate the results.
I decided to spend much time optimising the various algorithms that I used in the project: my primary purpose was to showcase the type of app that I can make from scratch. I developed the app with a quirky design theme in mind, it can be viewed [here](https://isaacgamal.shinyapps.io/ChurnRate/). I am currently in the process of refashioning, moreover jazzing up the app with new javascript functionalities: I intend to release the new version soon.
